# Overview

In this project, I build a simple but functioning web chat tool using Socket.io and JavaScript.
I created both the the server and client sides. 

To start the server, you must have node.js installed on your computer. Once you do, open 'index.js' and 
make sure your terminal resides in the folder 'js network'; do 'npm install' in the terminal, and then 
'node index.js' to start the server up. You can now go to 'localhost:3000' to open up a client, and to 
see the program at work, open up another tab of the same 'localhost:3000', and you will see that the 
messages will be visible on both tabs.

I did this project to learn how to network using JavaScript, to learn about sockets, how to use an 
API.

# Network Communication

I used client/server architecture for this application. The client can be found on 
'localhost:3000' after the server is started.

Messages are sent back and forth as strings.

# Development Environment

I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS, the Socket.io library, and 
node.js for this application.
